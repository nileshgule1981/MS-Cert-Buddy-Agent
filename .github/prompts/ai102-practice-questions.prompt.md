# AI-102 Practice Question

Generate **ONE** original, exam-realistic **AI-102** practice question.

## Use this skill

You must follow the workspace skill **ai102-item-creator** for item structure, guardrails, and **delivery rules** (Phase 1 / Phase 2 interactive flow).

## Inputs (from chat)

- Skill area: ${input:skillArea:Pick an AI-102 skill area (or leave blank and the agent picks one)}
- Objective: ${input:objective:Specific objective line to measure (optional)}
- Bloom: ${input:bloom:Remember | Understand | Apply | Analyze}
- Difficulty: ${input:difficulty:easy | medium | hard}
- Item type: ${input:itemType:multiple-choice (A-D, single answer)}

## Grounding and validation rules

1. Ground the correct behavior in **Microsoft Learn** using **Context7** tools (which index Learn documentation) and Copilot web search.
2. If the item includes CLI/PowerShell syntax, confirm with **Context7** tools.
3. If you claim a command/property exists or works in a particular way, sanity-check with **Azure MCP** tools.
4. Provide **Microsoft Learn URLs** in the Phase 2 References section.

## Terminology

Always use current Microsoft product names. Never use retired names (for example, "Azure AD" must be "Microsoft Entra ID"). See the full rename table in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Output format (exact) -- two-phase delivery

## Style rules

- No negatives unless absolutely required; if used, bold the negative word.
- Distractors must be plausible and real Azure options (no invented services/flags).
- All Azure product names must use current terminology (no retired names).
